# My Python Notebook Project

This is a Python project that includes Jupyter Notebooks, Python scripts, data files, and a requirements.txt file.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
my-python-notebook-project
├── notebooks
│   └── example_notebook.ipynb
├── src
│   └── example_script.py
├── data
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

## Files and Directories

- `notebooks/example_notebook.ipynb`: This file is a Jupyter Notebook that contains Python code and markdown cells. It can be used for data analysis, visualization, and documentation.

- `src/example_script.py`: This file is a Python script that contains code for data processing, analysis, or any other functionality required for the project.

- `data`: This directory is used to store data files that are used by the notebooks or scripts.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python packages and their versions required for the project. It can be used to install the dependencies using `pip`.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. You can now run the Jupyter Notebooks or execute the Python scripts in the `src` directory.

## Usage

- Open the Jupyter Notebook `notebooks/example_notebook.ipynb` to start working on your data analysis, visualization, or documentation tasks.

- Modify the Python script `src/example_script.py` to add or modify functionality for data processing or analysis.

- Store your data files in the `data` directory and access them from the notebooks or scripts.
